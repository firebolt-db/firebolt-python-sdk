    Async integration test for database context preservation with caching on Firebolt.

    This test verifies against a live Firebolt instance:
    1. Connect with database1 + engine1 (cache entry created)
    2. Connect with database2 + engine1 (should add database2 to cache)
    3. Cursors from second connection should have database2, not database1
