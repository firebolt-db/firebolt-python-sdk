Async integration test for database context preservation with caching on Firebolt.

This test verifies against a live Firebolt instance:
1. Connect with database1 + engine1 (cache entry created)
2. Connect with database2 + engine1 (should add database2 to cache)
3. Cursors from second connection should have database2, not database1
